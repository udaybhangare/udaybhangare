# 👋 Yo, I'm Uday

Full-stack dev who likes building things that actually work.  
I care about **clean systems**, **type safety**, and **shipping without drama**.

Currently deep into:
- TypeScript & Next.js
- Rust + Tauri desktop apps
- Backend system design
- AI integrations that make sense (not buzzwords)

---

## 🧠 What I’m about

- I enjoy turning messy ideas into clean, scalable systems
- Strong believer in **DX > hype**
- Prefer shipping over overthinking
- If it compiles, scales, and doesn’t wake me up at 3am — it’s good code

---

## 🛠 Tech I Touch (a lot)

**Frontend**
- Next.js
- React
- TypeScript

**Backend**
- System design
- Express / Spring Boot
- API architecture

**Desktop**
- Tauri
- Rust + frontend integration
- Cross-platform builds

**AI / ML**
- Python
- Model inference
- Plugging ML into real apps

---

## 🧩 Outside the code

- Hackathons 🏆
- Building late-night ideas that may or may not become startups
- Learning by breaking things (responsibly)

If you're:
- hopping on a hackathon  
- building something interesting  
- or just want to talk tech  

**let’s connect.**
